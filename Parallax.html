        <h2>Ben Tennyson</h2>
        <p>The series centers on Ben Tennyson, a 10-year-old boy on a summer vacation road trip with his cousin Gwen and their grandfather Max. (Max is later revealed to be a member of a secret intergalactic organization called the Plumbers.) On their first night camping in their grandfather's RV, nicknamed the Rust Bucket, Ben finds a mysterious watch-like alien device that sticks itself upon his wrist, giving him the ability to transform into several (initially ten but later more) alien life-forms, each with special abilities. During their vacation, the Tennysons are attacked by various enemies, ranging from aliens such as intergalactic warlord Vilgax, bounty hunter duo Sixsix and Kraab, Ectonurite high king Zs'skayr, an 11-year-old delinquent named Kevin Levin who has the ability to absorb energy, mad scientist Doctor Animo, mysterious paramilitary organization the Forever Knights, supernatural entities such as interdimensional sorcerer Hex and his niece Charmcaster, and clown mastermind Zombozo and his Circus Freak Trio.</p>

        <h2>Omnitrix</h2>
        <p>The Omnitrix, its Ultimatrix replacement, and the "finalized" version that is the New Omnitrix are the central elements of the Ben 10 story. They are all wristwatch-styled devices developed by the Galvan inventor Azmuth that transforms the user into any one of many alien beings (originally 1,000,906, but the number has increased by 9 via scanning additional species not originally in the database). Despite many seeing the Omnitrix as a weapon, its true purpose was to allow the beings of the universe to understand each other and to resurrect intelligent species that may go extinct.</p>

        <h2>Plumbers: The Inter-Galactic Police</h2>
        <p>The Plumbers is an organization composed of both human and alien members, each of whom possesses a special badge. All badges bear the intergalactic peace symbol, a green hourglass shape, which is on the faceplate of the Omnitrix. Later, in Omniverse, the Plumbers' symbol becomes a red dot.In the original series, the Earth's Plumbers were a secret government organization that protected the universe from any threat. Their main base is located inside Mount Rushmore (where the Null Void projector and Sub-Energy were stored), with additional bases located inside Fort Knox, the Space Needle, Devils Tower, the Navajo Monument, the Great Dismal Swamp, and major cities such as Roswell, New York City, New Orleans, Denver, Los Angeles, Chicago, Orlando, and Grand Rapids. Their main adversary was Vilgax. Max Tennyson was a Plumber in his youth. Most of the Plumbers on Earth have disbanded; however, a few members remain in a semi-active capacity.</p>
